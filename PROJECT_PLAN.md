# Project Plan (4 Weeks)

## Week 1: Scope + Data Collection
- Choose policy focus (example: student loan policy discourse + housing policy in one target city).
- Create API keys and collect at least 300-500 Reddit posts.
- Download one public housing dataset with monthly observations.

## Week 2: Sentiment Pipeline + Lead Indicator Framing
- Run sentiment scoring and quality checks.
- Build daily sentiment index and volume plot.
- Draft hypothesis: sentiment shifts anticipate measurable behavior/outcome changes.

## Week 3: Policy Impact EDA
- Define policy implementation date.
- Construct pre/post 12-month comparison.
- Generate chart and summary statistics.

## Week 4: Integration + Storytelling
- Connect sentiment expectations to observed outcome changes.
- Write final memo and prepare a short slide deck.
- Include limits and next-step methods for causal rigor.

## Evaluation Checklist
- Reproducible scripts and documented inputs.
- Clear data provenance and assumptions.
- Visuals with direct interpretation.
- Explicit link between behavioral incentives and outcomes.
